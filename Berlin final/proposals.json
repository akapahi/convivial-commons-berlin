By 2040: many more street and park trees, cooler streets through de-sealing and sponge-city measures, heat action plans in every borough, and one clear system to track progress. Boroughs get dedicated budgets for green, water, and shade. The Senate publishes simple annual updates on money and results. Decision: approve or reject.",

Urban designs will also follow low-car mobility and with a focus on green corridors while the center of the Feld is being kept open as a park. Decision: approve to build on the Feld or reject to leave it 100% open.",

The pre-check must show clear public benefits: better sports spaces, transport upgrades, and lasting green and public places. If these are not met, the idea stops. Decision: approve or reject.",
